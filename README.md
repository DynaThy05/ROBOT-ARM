# ROBOT-ARM
In the dynamic landscape of Cambodiaâ€™s transition toward Industry 4.0, the demand for skilled professionals proficient in robotics and automation technologies is rapidly increasing. Our team as robotics students, aims to build a mini flexible dual-axis robot using Arduino to enhance our skill for future career.

Our team is going to build a very basic mini-robot arm using Arduino as a microcontroller programmed using C language.

We are facing in writing an easy readable code, 3D printing out some of the parts,and having to learn everything from scratch. We don't having enough components resources. Although, components circuiting is the most challenging part of the project.

In this project, it would help us to know a little more about robotics coding as well as 3D designs for future robotics project.
