# ROBOT-ARM
In Cambodiaâ€™s shift towards Industry 4.0, the demand for skilled professionals in robotics and automation is rising. 
As robotics students, we're building a mini flexible dual-axis robot using Arduino to enhance our skills for future careers. 
Our project involves creating a basic robot arm, with Arduino as the microcontroller programmed in C.

We face challenges in writing readable code, 3D printing parts, and learning from scratch. We're also short on components, making circuiting the most challenging aspect. 
This project will deepen our understanding of robotics coding and 3D design, benefiting our future projects.
